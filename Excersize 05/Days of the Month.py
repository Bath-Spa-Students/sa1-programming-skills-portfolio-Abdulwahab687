## Exercise 5: Days of the Month - 30 Marks

Write a program that tells a user how many days there are in a specific month. Use a dictionary to map the month numbers (1-12) to the number of days in each month.

### Instructions:
1. Create a Dictionary: Define a dictionary where the keys are month numbers and the values are the number of days in those months.
2. Input Handling: Ask the user to input the month number.
3. Check and Output: Use an if-else statement to check if the input is valid and print the number of days in the corresponding month.

### Advanced Requirement:
Leap Year Adjustment: Modify the program to account for leap years. For February, ask the user if the year is a leap year and adjust the number of days accordingly.

# Get month number from user
month = int(input("Enter month number (1-12): "))

# Check if month is valid and print result
if 1 <= month <= 12:

else:
    print("Invalid month number. Please enter a number between 1 and 12")
