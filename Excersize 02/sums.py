## Exercise 2: Simple Sums - 15 Marks
In this exercise, you will create and work with integer variables, perform arithmetic operations, and print the result to the console.

### Steps:
1. Declare a variable and initialize it with the integer value `8`.
2. Declare a second variable and initialize it with the integer value `10`.
3. Declare a third variable that stores the sum of first two numbers.
4. Print the value of the sum to the console.

# Solution 1: Step-by-step approach with detailed variable naming
# Initialize first number
num1 = 8    # Starting value for our addition operation

# Initialize second number
num2 = 10   # Second value to be added

# Calculate and store the sum of the two numbers
total_sum = num1 + num2    # Using descriptive variable name for better code readability

# Display the result using string formatting
print(f"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is: {total_sum}")    # Format string provides clear output context
